I've been a bit enraptured by nostalgia recently.

In the process of looking back at the media that made formative impressions on me, I sometimes stumble upon a strange feeling. When I was pretty young, I watched The Truman Show in school. I loved it. It was an early example of the combination of comedy and existential horror that would come to typify the movies, shows, and games I would love in the coming years. I watched it again recently, and it's still amazing, but there's something... missing.

For those who don't know, one of the pieces of The Truman Show's premise is that the titular Truman Burbank is, unbeknownst to him, the star of an internationally popular TV show. His life, his family, his hometown - all of them are scripted fabrications created with the aim of producing popular - and profitable - entertainment. The other piece of The Truman Show's premise is that you will find the idea of being Truman - and of *creating* Truman - demonic, and incomprehensibly horrifying.

On rewatch, I am still horrified by Truman's condition. Unfortunately, I find it deeply, deeply comprehensible.

When I watched the film originally, the dawn of influencer culture had already begun. Even before that, reality television had begun its shift towards mainstream acceptance and success. The movie's assumption was that the idea of being Truman was so self-evidently repulsive that it could instrumentalized for the purposes of horror. It also assumed that the actions of Christof - the in-universe showrunner - would be instantly regarded as the behavior of a deranged, narcissistic psychopath. The reality - that millions of people every day would fight to the death for the right to be Truman, that thousands of families would jump at the chance to turn their children into Truman, in many cases using *exactly the same justifications* that Christof does - has made the film feel, ironically enough, naive. Yet another vision of dystopia that has been totally eclipsed by the real world.

This dynamic doesn't always work against a piece of art. In The Truman Show's case, this absence of acknowledgement of our own world of fabrications and "reality" entertainment can add to the film's horror. But once you go looking for this dynamic, you can see it everywhere. Especially in places where it was never intended to be.

I recently read musician and artist Patti Smith's memoir, *Just Kids*. It is a tender and heartfelt account of her relationship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Smith is an undeniably skilled storyteller. She is able to create vivid tapestries of not only her life during this time but of the time itself - but every so often, Smith will offhandedly say something... wild.

> On the third day I found two quarters embedded in the grass in the park. We had coffee, toast, and jam, and split an egg at the Waverly Diner. Fifty cents was real money in 1967.

And then she does it again.

And then, you start to see a pattern.

I feel... kind of evil, for feeling the way I do about Just Kids. Smith set out to write an impassioned memoir o fulfill a deathbed vow she made to her best friend, and she succeeded - and in the process, laid out one of the most complete visions of the late 60's that I've ever seen. The fact that her anecdotes reflect a world that is completely and totally dead - that even the stories of strife she tells reveal a kind of liberated existence that is totally lost to a Zoomer like myself - isn't her fault. Transforming this deeply personal work of art into a cold, materialistic account of the price of housing, or stagnant wages, or the state of a pre-social media counter-culture, feels almost sacrilegious.

And yet, the power of the modern world to desacralize the past remains unstoppable - even by actual religion.

The very first piece I ever wrote for Down the Ladder was about an art installation by Canadian sculptor Timothy Schmalz. The installation is called "Homeless Jesus," and, appropriately, it is a statue of Jesus Christ in tattered rags, curled up on what appears to be a modern city bench. By design, it's a confronting statue. Schmalz intended to make a point about the way we - especially Western Christians - have created a warped idea of Jesus's image that is, in essence, a fabrication by elites. The reality, or, at least, the biblical presentation of Jesus's life, is much closer to that of a modern homeless person - that is to say, the sort of person who many of his  modern followers would turn a blind eye to. Schmalz was wildly successful in making this point - as proven when a Bay Village, Ohio resident called the police on the statue, mistaking it for an actual homeless person.

And, that should have been the end of it. Schmalz set out to make his point, and he did. But I didn't encounter Homeless Jesus through a news story or an academic article. I encountered it on the street, while walking home with my mother. At the time, I had none of the context that I just gave you. I didn't even put together that it was supposed to be Jesus until a friend - who had seen the statue at another place before - pointed out the stigmata on his feet. The context I did have, however, was the inexorable march of hostile architecture. 

Part of the reason why Homeless Jesus stood out to my mother and I that night was because it is actually unusual to see a homeless person sleeping on a bench like this in Orlando. Across the street from the statue was a county building with benches out front - unsurprisingly decked out with the bars in the middle to prevent sleeping. It seems silly, in hindsight, to have assumed this statue was intended to be hostile architecture. But in the context of the surrounding area - the intentions don't really matter much. For us, the sort of people who get to watch video essays on Youtube for fun, it gets to be a statement piece. If you actually needed to sleep somewhere, it is just another bench reminding you that you can't.

I try to be weary of what historian Jon Meacham calls the narcissism of the present - the belief that your current conditions are uniquely triumphant or terrible in comparison to a bastardized version of the past. In spite of that, it's hard to not think that the last few decades have *done* something to art and culture, that the speed of human events has reached a point where the shelf life of a statement piece is measured in months instead of decades.

None of the works of art I've discussed today were in any way failures. All of them were *successful* in accomplishing what they set out to do in their time. And *that* is the terrifying part - that even the most resonant, most meaningful works of art are not immune to the withering of time, that you can be completely successful in depicting your vision and the forward march of society will just bulldoze right through it, that the conditions of the present will demean, diminish, and distract from the meaning that you created, and that the ability to understand the thing the way it was meant to be understood will be lost to time faster than the thing itself.

I don't really have a solution to this problem. You could try to preempt the march of time, but that requires you to predict the future correctly, something that was seldom possible even before history shifted into overdrive. You could just ignore it and create things with the knowledge that a dystopia in January will become reality by July, and a quaint vision of the past by October. Or - and this is about the only thing I can think of - you can try to pull things back. 

The conditions that have warped these works of art weren't inevitabilities - or, at least, for life to have meaning at all, we need to proceed as if they weren't inevitabilities. Maybe there's a future where "Homeless Jesus" becomes a statue again and not a bench you can't lay on. Maybe there's a future where Just Kids becomes a reminder that the past was not so different from our present. Maybe there's a future where The Truman Show is as incomprehensible a horror to our grandchildren as it was to our parents.

I don't know if that will be our future. But I think we owe it to these works to try to make sure that it is.
